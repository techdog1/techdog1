In my search for how to set fixed usb port names. I found an article that had some good advice, but relied on wine and symbolic links. 
The information was good to use to identify the usb attributes that I needed to config the settings.
Using wine and links is not how I wanted to do it.
I used the command "dmesg | grep ttyUSB" to find the assigned ports for ttyUSB0 and ttyUSB1
I wanted USB1 to be assigned to the Bus 001 Device 004: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port.
I wanted ISB0 to be assigned to the Bus 001 Device 006: ID 10c4:ea60 Cygnal Integrated Products, Inc. CP2102/CP2109 UART Bridge Controller [CP210x family]
Then I used the command "udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSB0 --attribute-walk", to find the all of the attributes for the USB port connected devices.
I was looking for the ATTRS such as the idProduct: xx, or idVendor:xx, or other attribute values to use to differentiate the devices.

Removed the usb pendrive and re-connecting the GPS with a different cable (long one).

To set the usb port rules

In a Terminal window use sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb-serial.rules to enter and save identity attributes for each 
attached USB device'50-usb-serial.rules'.
I used the information from the list of attributes to specify the identity of the devices to a specific USB port.
 
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="067b", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2303", SYMLINK+="ttyUSB_DEVICE4" 
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="10c4", ATTRS{idProduct}=="ea60", SYMLINK+="ttyUSB_DEVICE6" 


Then <ctrl> O <enter> to save the file and <ctrl> X to exit the nano editor. 
After I created the rules I used the command "sudo udevadm trigger" so the rules will be applied.

I then issued the command "ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*" to list the names and USB ports assigned.
