- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @techdog1
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building a digital dash for my Bronco II using a Raspberry 3+ running Tuner studio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to assign USB ports and com ports to specific devices. 
- Other things to figure out include how to configure cutom channels using the custom channel editer to use as an analog input for Oil pressure and Fuel level
- I recently switched to a GMKtec Mini PC Windows 11 Pro Nucbox to replace the RPi 3 because the wait list for a RPi 5 was too long.
- It is working very well.
- Except when it is not.
- Windows 11 does not like to be kept in an dissconnected environment.
- The longer it is dissconnected the longer and longer it takes to boot, especially after a hard shutdown (power off)
